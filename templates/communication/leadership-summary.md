## Example

```
## Leadership Summary

### Leadership Summary
Customer is receiving false alerts saying all servers are down when they are actually running. The issue is a configuration problem with how the monitoring system authenticates. A simple settings change will resolve it.

### Investigation
Confirmed the alerts fired because the monitoring system could not verify its connection. Checked for platform outages and found none. Root cause is settings issue on customer side.

### Next Steps
Waiting for customer to verify one setting in their configuration. Once confirmed, TSE guide them through a quick fix that carries no risk.
